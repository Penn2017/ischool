      when I finish this project ,I also say goodbye to my old times. whatever  school-times or old muddled time.<br>
     this project will be my first work that I used to knock the real pro-coding world.<br>
     so , I tell myself ,work on it ,and enjoy it ,and by the way ,there is one man said ,life is short,do something
     makes youself happy ,for me ,it is also be this.<br>
    <b>at the end ,I will come back and said ,
     there is always something that I will take lots of time to working it out ,but I still step on it , no matter who is or will leave .<br>
